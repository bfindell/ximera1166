This construction $\answer[format=string]{bisects} \angle A$.  
\begin{problem}
Correct!  The construction works because $AD=\answer{AC}$, 
$DE=\answer{CE}$, and $AE=\answer{AE}$ so that $\triangle ADE \cong \triangle \answer[format=string]{ACE}$ 
by $\answer[format=string]{SSS}$.  

Then $\angle DAE\cong \angle \answer[format=string]{CAE}$ from the congruent triangles.  

Note also that quadrilateral $ACED$ is a $\answer[format=string]{kite}$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Draw a circle with its center being the vertex of the 
angle.
%\item Draw a line segment where the circle intersects the lines.
%\item Bisect the new line segment.  The bisector will bisect the angle.
\item At each of the points where that circle intersects the sides of the angle, draw a circle with the same radius.

\begin{hint}%[Copying an Angle]\index{compass and straightedge!copying an angle} 
%Given a point on a line and some angle, we wish to copy the 
%given angle so that the new angle has the point as its 
%vertex and the line as one of its edges.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Open the compass to a fixed width and make a circle 
centered at the vertex of the angle.
\item Make a circle of the same radius on the line with the point [or on the ray].
\item Open the compass so that one end touches the first circle 
where it hits one side of the original angle, with the other end of the compass extended to where the first circle hits the other side of the original angle.
\item Draw a circle with the radius found above with its center 
where the second circle hits the line.
\item Connect the point to where the circles meet. This is the other side of the angle we are constructing.
