\begin{problem}
Construct (exactly) the triangle centers in the following 
GeoGebra sketch, and use the GeoGebra tool to measure the requested distances (to three decimal places). 

Note: The sketch below requires a ``custom toolbar'' with a subset of the GeoGebra tools.  If the custom toolbar doesn't appear, click 
\link[here]{https://www.geogebra.org/m/mmucerza} to open the sketch as a full page.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The radius of the circumcircle of $\triangle ABC$ is 
$\answer{5.751}$.  

Note: Remember to reset the figure between parts.   

\item The radius of the incircle of $\triangle ABC$ is 
$\answer{0.995}$.  

\item Let $G$ be the centroid of $\triangle ABC$.  
Then $AG = \answer{4.856}$, $BG = \answer{1.525}$, 
and $CG = \answer{4.253}$.  

\item Let H be the orthocenter of $\triangle ABC$. 
Then $AH = \answer{10.725}$, $BH = \answer{7.16}$, 
and $CH = \answer{9.927}$. 
\end{enumerate}
