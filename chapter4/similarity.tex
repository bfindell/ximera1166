%To define a translation, rotation, or reflection, we indicate the image of a generic point $P$ under the transformation as specified.  
%
%Under a rotation about center $O$ counterclockwise by an angle $\theta$, the image of $P$ is 
%a point $Q$ so that $OQ = OP$ and $m\angle POQ = \theta$, measured counterclockwise 
%from $\overrightarrow{OP}$ to $\overrightarrow{OQ}$.  If $P = O$ then $Q=O=P$.  % if $\theta<0$ 
%
%Under a translation by the distance and direction from $A$ to $B$, the image of $P$ is a point $Q$ so 
%that $\overline{PQ} \parallel \overline{AB}$, $PQ=AB$, and $\overrightarrow{PQ}$ is in the same direction as $\overrightarrow{AB}$.  
%
%Under a reflection about a line $\ell$, if $P$ is on $\ell$, then $P$ is mapped to itself.  If $P$ is not on $\ell$, then the image of $P$ is a point $Q$ so that $\ell$ is the perpendicular bisector of $\overline{PQ}$.

\begin{question}
\textbf{Definition.} Under a \textbf{dilation} about center $O$ and scale factor $r>0$, the image of $P$ is 
a point $Q$ so that $Q$ lies on \wordChoice{\choice{segment}\choice[correct]{ray}\choice{line}} 
$\answer[format=string]{OP}$ % $\overrightarrow{OP}$ 
and $OQ=\answer[format=string]{rOP}$.  The image of $O$ is $\answer[format=string]{O}$.

\begin{question}
%Describe, both informally and formally, what it means to say two figures are congruent.
Informally, if one figure can be ``placed upon'' another so that the figures match exactly, the figures are said to be $\answer[format=string]{congruent}$.  This is called the ``principle of superposition.''  
\begin{question}
Formally, two figures are \textbf{congruent} if there is a sequence of $\answer[format=string]{basic rigid motions}$ (three words) that maps one onto the other.  
\end{question}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
%Describe, both informally and formally, what it means to say two figures are similar.
Informally, figures that have the ``same shape'' are said to be $\answer[format=string]{similar}$.  With moving and scaling, one figure can be placed on another so that the figures match exactly.    
\begin{question}
Formally, two figures are \textbf{similar} if there is a sequence of basic rigid motions and $\answer[format=string]{dilations}$ that maps one onto the other.  
\end{question}
\end{question}


\begin{question}
Compare and contrast the ideas of \textit{equal triangles},
  \textit{congruent triangles}, and \textit{similar triangles}.
\begin{freeResponse}
\end{freeResponse}
\begin{hint}
Two triangles are equal if they are the same sets of points.  For example, you could write $\triangle ABC = \triangle BCA$ because they are the same triangle, but this notation is misleading and rarely used.  

Congruence and similarity are defined above.  Two triangles that are congruent have the same angles measures and side lengths.  Two triangles that are similar, it turns out, have the same angle measures.  
\end{hint}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
A student says that any two rectangles are similar because all the angles are the same.  Is the student correct?  
\wordChoice{\choice{Yes.}\choice[correct]{No.}\choice{Not enough information.}} Explain. 
\begin{question}
Two rectangles are similar only if there is a single $\answer[format=string]{scale factor}$ (two words) that works for both the length and width.  Angles alone are not enough for quadrilaterals.  
\end{question}
\end{question}

\begin{question}When figures are similar, ratios of corresponding lengths must be equal.  We distinguish \textbf{``within figure''} and \textbf{``between figure''} ratios.  
 
Suppose $\triangle ABC \sim \triangle XYZ$.  Complete the following equation relating ratios \textbf{within} the figures: 
\[
\frac{AB}{\answer{BC}} = \frac{\answer{XY}}{YZ}.  
\]
Complete the following equation relating ratios \textbf{between} the figures: 
\[
\frac{AB}{\answer{XY}} = \frac{\answer{BC}}{YZ}.  
\]
A ratio between (or across) corresponding lengths from two similar figures is 
called a $\answer[format=string]{scale}$ factor.  
\end{question}


\begin{question}
Are all equilateral triangles are similar to each other?  
\wordChoice{\choice[correct]{Yes.}\choice{No.}\choice{It depends.}} Explain.  
\begin{question}
Equilateral triangles have interior angles that all measure $\answer{60}$ degrees.  So all equilateral triangles are similar to one another by AAA similarity.  
\end{question}
\end{question}

\begin{question}Are all isosceles right triangles similar to each other? 
\wordChoice{\choice[correct]{Yes.}\choice{No.}\choice{It depends.}} Explain.  
\begin{question}
Isosceles right triangles have interior angles that measure $90$, $\answer{45}$, and $\answer{45}$ degrees.  So all equilateral triangles are similar to one another by AAA similarity.  
\end{question}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Explain why when given a right triangle, the 
\wordChoice{\choice[correct]{altitude}\choice{median}\choice{perpendicular bisector}\choice{angle bisector}}
from the right angle divides the triangle into two smaller triangles each
  similar to the original right triangle.
\begin{question}
Because that altitude \wordChoice{\choice{intersects}\choice{bisects}\choice[correct]{is perpendicular to}} the hypotenuse, each of the two smaller triangles has a 
$\answer[format=string]{right}$ angle. Each of the smaller triangles also \textbf{shares} a(n) 
\wordChoice{\choice{obtuse}\choice[correct]{acute}\choice{right}\choice{supplementary}}
angle with the original triangle.  Thus, by \wordChoice{\choice{SAS}\choice{SAA}\choice{SSS}\choice[correct]{AA}}
similarity, each of the smaller triangles is similar to the large triangle, and therefore the three triangles must be similar to one another.  
\end{question}
\end{question}

A \textit{Pythagorean Triple}\index{Pythagorean Triple} is a set

  $\answer[format=string]{yes}$. 
  Explain. 
\begin{question}

\begin{question}
During a solar eclipse we see that the apparent diameter of the
  Sun and Moon are nearly equal. If the Moon is around $240,000$ miles

  diameter is about $865,000$ miles how far is the Sun from the Earth?

\begin{question}
When jets fly above $8,000$ meters in the air they form a vapor
  trail. Cruising altitude for a commercial airliner is around $10,000$
  meters. One day I reached my arm into the sky and measured the
  length of the vapor trail with my hand---my hand could just span the
  entire trail. If my hand spans $9$ inches and my arm extends $25$
  inches from my eye, how long is the vapor trail in \textbf{kilometers}?

%\begin{question}
%I was walking down Woody Hayes Drive, standing in front of
%  St.\ John Arena when a car pulled up and the driver asked, ``Where
%  is Ohio Stadium?'' At this point I was a bit perplexed, but
%  nevertheless I answered, ``Do you see the enormous concrete building
%  on the other side of the street that looks like the Roman Colosseum?
%  That's it.''
% 
%The person in the car then asked, ``Where are the Twin-Towers then?''
%Looking up, I realized that the towers were in fact just covered by
%top of Ohio Stadium. I told the driver to just drive around the
%stadium until they found two enormous identical towers---that would be
%them. They thanked me and I suppose they met their destiny.
%
%I am about 2 meters tall, I was standing about 100 meters from the
%Ohio Stadium and Ohio Stadium is about 40 meters tall. If the Towers
%are around 500 meters from the rotunda (the front entrance of the
%stadium), how tall could they be and still be obscured by the stadium?
%Explain your reasoning---for the record, the towers are about 80
%meters tall.

\begin{question}
Use the definition of similarity (in terms of transformations) to prove that all circles are similar.  

\textbf{Comment:} We need to describe a general sequence of 
$\answer[format=string]{basic rigid motions}$ 
(three words) and $\answer[format=string]{dilations}$ that maps one circle onto the other.  

\begin{question}
\textbf{Sketch of proof:}  Translate one circle by the 
\wordChoice{\choice{line}\choice{angle}\choice[correct]{vector}\choice{ray}} 
between the centers so that centers coincide.  Dilate about the (now common) center by the 
\wordChoice{\choice{product}\choice[correct]{ratio}\choice{sum}\choice{difference}}  
of the radii.  Then the circles will coincide.

\begin{hint}
We are given a small right triangle with legs $a$ and $b$ and hypotenuse $c$.  We want to show that $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.  

Sketch of proof:  The arrows represent scaling of that triangle by scale factors $b$, $a$, and $c$, resulting in three right triangles with side lengths as labeled.  The segments of length $a^2$ and $b^2$ are collinear (why?), which implies the two medium-sized triangles make a single large triangle on the left.  The large triangle on the left is a right triangle.  (Why?)  The two large triangles are congruent.  (Why?)  Then $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.  (Why?)
