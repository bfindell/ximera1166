\begin{question}
Explain why when given a right triangle, the 
\wordChoice{\choice[correct]{altitude}\choice{median}\choice{perpendicular bisector}\choice{angle bisector}}
from the right angle divides the triangle into two smaller triangles each
  similar to the original right triangle.
\begin{question}
Because that altitude \wordChoice{\choice{intersects}\choice{bisects}\choice[correct]{is perpendicular to}} the hypotenuse, each of the two smaller triangles has a 
$\answer[format=string]{right}$ angle. Each of the smaller triangles also \textbf{shares} a(n) 
\wordChoice{\choice{obtuse}\choice[correct]{acute}\choice{right}\choice{supplementary}}
angle with the original triangle.  Thus, by \wordChoice{\choice{SAS}\choice{SAA}\choice{SSS}\choice[correct]{AA}}
similarity, each of the smaller triangles is similar to the large triangle, and therefore the three triangles must be similar to one another.

\begin{question}
A \textit{Pythagorean Triple}\index{Pythagorean Triple} is a set
  of three positive integers $\{a,b,c\}$ such that $a^2 + b^2 =
  c^2$. Here are some useful ones (always listing the hypotenuse last): 
\begin{enumerate}
\item 3, 4, $\answer{5}$
\item 5, $\answer{12}$, 13
\item $\answer{8}$, 15, 17
\item 7, 24, $\answer{25}$
\end{enumerate}
  Is it possible to describe an infinite list of Pythagorean Triples?  
  $\answer[format=string]{yes}$. 
  Explain. 
\begin{question}
Scale any Pythagorean triple by an integer scale factor greater than 1, and you have another Pythagorean triple.  For example, because \{3, 4, 5\} is a Pythagorean triple, so is \{$3n$, $\answer{4n}$, $\answer{5n}$\}, where $n \ge 1$ is an $\answer[format=string]{integer}$.

\begin{question}
Suppose two triangles are similar with scale factor $r$. Is it possible to state relationships between their perimeters?  Their areas?
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{Not without more information}
\choice{Only between their perimeters}
\choice{Only between their areas}
\choice[correct]{Yes}
\end{multipleChoice}
\begin{question}
When triangles are similar with a scale factor of $r$, 
the ratio of their perimeters is $\answer{r}$, and  
the ratio of their areas is $\answer{r^2}$.

\begin{question}
During a solar eclipse we see that the apparent diameter of the
  Sun and Moon are nearly equal. If the Moon is around $240,000$ miles
  from Earth, the Moon's diameter is about $2000$ miles, and the Sun's
  diameter is about $865,000$ miles how far is the Sun from the Earth?

%\item Solve this problem, be sure to explain your reasoning.

Distance to sun $\approx \answer{(865000/2000)240000}$ miles.

\begin{question}
When jets fly above $8,000$ meters in the air they form a vapor
  trail. Cruising altitude for a commercial airliner is around $10,000$
  meters. One day I reached my arm into the sky and measured the
  length of the vapor trail with my hand---my hand could just span the
  entire trail. If my hand spans $9$ inches and my arm extends $25$
  inches from my eye, how long is the vapor trail in \textbf{kilometers}? 
  %Explain your reasoning.
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Draw a relevant (and helpful) picture showing the important
%  points of this problem.
%\item Solve this problem, be sure to explain your reasoning.

Length of vapor trail $\approx \answer{(10/25)9}$ km.

David proudly owns a 42 inch (measured diagonally) flat screen
  TV. Michael proudly owns a 13 inch (measured diagonally) flat screen
  TV. The TVs are geometrically similar. Dave sits comfortably with his dog 
  Fritz at a distance of 10
  feet. How far must Michael stand from his TV to have the ``same''
  viewing experience?  Explain your reasoning.

%You love IMAX movies. While the typical IMAX screen is 72 feet

%\begin{question}
%I was walking down Woody Hayes Drive, standing in front of
%  St.\ John Arena when a car pulled up and the driver asked, ``Where
%  is Ohio Stadium?'' At this point I was a bit perplexed, but
%  nevertheless I answered, ``Do you see the enormous concrete building
%  on the other side of the street that looks like the Roman Colosseum?
%  That's it.''
% 
%The person in the car then asked, ``Where are the Twin-Towers then?''
%Looking up, I realized that the towers were in fact just covered by
%top of Ohio Stadium. I told the driver to just drive around the
%stadium until they found two enormous identical towers---that would be
%them. They thanked me and I suppose they met their destiny.
%
%I am about 2 meters tall, I was standing about 100 meters from the
%Ohio Stadium and Ohio Stadium is about 40 meters tall. If the Towers
%are around 500 meters from the rotunda (the front entrance of the
%stadium), how tall could they be and still be obscured by the stadium?
%Explain your reasoning---for the record, the towers are about 80
%meters tall.

\begin{question}
Use the definition of similarity (in terms of transformations) to prove that all circles are similar.  

\textbf{Comment:} We need to describe a general sequence of 
$\answer[format=string]{basic rigid motions}$ 
(three words) and $\answer[format=string]{dilations}$ that maps one circle onto the other.  

\begin{question}
\textbf{Sketch of proof:}  Translate one circle by the 
\wordChoice{\choice{line}\choice{angle}\choice[correct]{vector}\choice{ray}} 
between the centers so that centers coincide.  Dilate about the (now common) center by the 
\wordChoice{\choice{product}\choice[correct]{ratio}\choice{sum}\choice{difference}}  
of the radii.  Then the circles will coincide.

\begin{hint}
We are given a small right triangle with legs $a$ and $b$ and hypotenuse $c$.  We want to show that $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.  

Sketch of proof:  The arrows represent scaling of that triangle by scale factors $b$, $a$, and $c$, resulting in three right triangles with side lengths as labeled.  The segments of length $a^2$ and $b^2$ are collinear (why?), which implies the two medium-sized triangles make a single large triangle on the left.  The large triangle on the left is a right triangle.  (Why?)  The two large triangles are congruent.  (Why?)  Then $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.  (Why?)
