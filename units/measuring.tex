\begin{problem}
According to the ruler below, what is the length of the blue segment? 
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=6in]{length1.png}
\end{center}
The length is $\answer{3+7/8}$.  
\begin{problem}
What are some common wrong answers?  

Noticing that the segment starts at $1$, not $0$.  Forgetting to subtract $1$. 

Thinking the tick marks show tenths rather than sixteenths.  

Let's actually count the tick marks between 4 and 5.  There are $\answer{15}$.  

If we begin at $4$, and count $1$ for the first tick mark to the right of $4$, then the 16th tick mark is at $5$.
