%\textbf{Definition.} Under a \textbf{dilation} about center $O$ and scale factor $r>0$, the image of $P$ is 
%a point $Q$ so that $Q$ lies on \wordChoice{\choice{segment}\choice[correct]{ray}\choice{line}}

%and $OQ=\answer[format=string]{rOP}$.  The image of $O$ is $\answer[format=string]{O}$. 

\section{Length, Area, and Volume Under Scaling}
In this section, we explore what happens to length, area, volume, and other measures under scaling.  
 

To explore how measures of figures change under scaling and non-scaling transformations, here are some useful strategies: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Cutting the figures and rearranging the pieces.  
\item Using ``rep-tiles.'' 
\item Using known formulas for perimeters, areas, volumes, or surface areas. 
\item Approximating with segments, squares, or cubes.  
\end{itemize}

% What about angles, perimeter, surface area, weight, and temperature
% Scaling versus stretching (other examples of non-scaling)
% Aspect ratio


\begin{question}
Given a cylinder of radius 5 and height 8, how many times greater will be the volume of \dots
\begin{enumerate}
\item \dots a cylinder with $k$ times the radius and the same height?  $\answer{k^2}$
\item \dots a cylinder with the same radius and $k$ times the height?  $\answer{k}$
\item \dots cylinder with $k$ times the radius and $k$ times the height?  $\answer{k^3}$
\end{enumerate}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Which of the following cylinders is similar to the given a cylinder of radius 5 and height 8?  
\begin{selectAll}
\choice{A cylinder with $k$ times the radius and the same height?}
\choice{A cylinder with the same radius and $k$ times the height?}
\choice[correct]{A cylinder with $k$ times the radius and $k$ times the height?}
\choice{None of the above}
\end{selectAll}

The similar cylinder will have surface area $\answer{k^2}$ times the surface area of the original cylinder.  
\end{question}

\begin{problem}
Some drugs work best when dosages are proportional to body surface area.  Other drugs work best when dosages are proportional to blood volume.  A typical adult male (5 ft 10 in, 175 lbs)  has a body surface area of about 2 square meters and about 5 liters of blood.  Scale these values up to estimate LeBron's body surface area and blood volume.  
\end{problem}

%\item LeBron James wears size 16 shoe.  Bart says a 5 ft 10 in version of LeBron would have a foot 7/8 as long.  Does this make sense?  Explain why or why not.  If not, give a better estimate.  
%\answer{This is fine because foot length is proportional to height.}
%\item Bart says that the scaled-down LeBron would wear size 14 shoe because 14 is 7/8 of 16.  Does this make sense?  Explain why or why not.  If not, give a better estimate of the scaled version's shoe size.  
%\answer{This is wrong because shoe size is not proportional to foot length.  Somehow suggest that students use Internet data to create a linear function relating foot length to shoe size, and they should get a result close to size 10, which is more sensible.} 

\begin{problem}
Consider a version of LeBron that is $d$ times as tall.  How would following quantities compare between the scaled version and the real LeBron:   leather in the sole of a shoe, shoe size, inseam, fabric in a T-shirt, lung capacity, neck circumference, and hat size.\footnote{Cool fact:  The size of a hat is the diameter (in inches) of the hat when it is reshaped into a circle.  Most adults have hat sizes between $6\frac{3}{4}$ and $8$.}  Explain briefly.  
%\answer{\begin{itemize}
%\item Inseam and neck circumference are lengths, so they will be $d$ times as big.  
%\item Hat size is proportional to head circumference, which is a length, so it also scales as $d$.  
%\item Shoe size is not really a length.  It varies with foot length but is not proportional to actual length measurements.  There is a non-proportional linear relationship.  
%\item Leather in the sole of the shoe and fabric in the T-shirt are both about area because their thicknesses stay constant.  They scale as $d^2$.  
%\item Lung capacity is about volume, so it scales as $d^3$.

\begin{problem}
A typical adult male gorilla is about 5.5 feet tall and weighs about 400 pounds. Suppose King Kong was about 22 feet tall and proportioned like a typical adult male gorilla.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Approximates King Kong's weight. Briefly explain your reasoning.
\item The circumference of the neck of a typical adult male gorilla is 36 inches. Approximately what would be the circumference of King Kong's neck? Briefly explain your reasoning.
\item Suppose an Ohio State sweatshirt for a typical adult male gorilla requires 3 square yards of fabric.  Approximately how much fabric would be required for an Ohio State sweatshirt for King Kong?  Briefly explain your reasoning.
\end{enumerate}
