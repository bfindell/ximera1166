%To define a translation, rotation, or reflection, we indicate the image of a generic point $P$ under the transformation as specified.  
%
%Under a rotation about center $O$ counterclockwise by an angle $\theta$, the image of $P$ is 
%a point $Q$ so that $OQ = OP$ and $m\angle POQ = \theta$, measured counterclockwise 
%from $\overrightarrow{OP}$ to $\overrightarrow{OQ}$.  If $P = O$ then $Q=O=P$.  % if $\theta<0$ 
%
%Under a translation by the distance and direction from $A$ to $B$, the image of $P$ is a point $Q$ so 
%that $\overline{PQ} \parallel \overline{AB}$, $PQ=AB$, and $\overrightarrow{PQ}$ is in the same direction as $\overrightarrow{AB}$.  
%
%Under a reflection about a line $\ell$, if $P$ is on $\ell$, then $P$ is mapped to itself.  If $P$ is not on $\ell$, then the image of $P$ is a point $Q$ so that $\ell$ is the perpendicular bisector of $\overline{PQ}$.

\begin{question}
\textbf{Definition.} Under a \textbf{dilation} about center $O$ and scale factor $r>0$, the image of $P$ is 
a point $Q$ so that $Q$ lies on $\overrightarrow{OP}$ and $OQ=\answer[format=string]{rOP}$.  The image of $O$ is $\answer[format=string]{O}$.

\begin{question}
Explain why when given a right triangle, the altitude of the
  right angle divides the triangle into two smaller triangles each
  similar to the original right triangle.
\begin{freeResponse}
\begin{hint}
Each of the two smaller triangles has a has a right angle and shares an acute angle with the original triangle.  So the triangles are congruent by AA similarity.

\begin{question}
Suppose you have two similar triangles. What can you say about
  the area of one in terms of the area of the other? Be specific and
  explain your reasoning.
\begin{freeResponse}
\begin{hint}
If the triangles are similar with a scale factor of $r$, then the ratio of their areas is $r^2$.

\begin{question}
During a solar eclipse we see that the apparent diameter of the
  Sun and Moon are nearly equal. If the Moon is around $240,000$ miles
  from Earth, the Moon's diameter is about $2000$ miles, and the Sun's
  diameter is about $865,000$ miles how far is the Sun from the Earth?
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Draw a relevant (and helpful) picture showing the important
%  points of this problem.
%\item Solve this problem, be sure to explain your reasoning.
%\end{enumerate}

%Distance to sun $\approx \answer{865000/2000*240000}$
Distance to sun $\approx \answer{8/2*3}$

\begin{question}
When jets fly above $8,000$ meters in the air they form a vapor
  trail. Cruising altitude for a commercial airliner is around $10,000$
  meters. One day I reached my arm into the sky and measured the
  length of the vapor trail with my hand---my hand could just span the
  entire trail. If my hand spans $9$ inches and my arm extends $25$
  inches from my eye, how long is the vapor trail? Explain your
  reasoning.

\item Draw a relevant (and helpful) picture showing the important

You love IMAX movies. While the typical IMAX screen is 72 feet

  the IMAX format? Explain your reasoning.

Here is a personal problem: Suppose you are out somewhere and
  you see that when you stretch out your arm, the width of your thumb
  is the same apparent size as a distant object. How far away is the
  object if you know the object is:
\begin{enumerate}
\item 6' long (as tall as a person).
\item 16' long (as long as a car).
\item 40' long (as long as a school bus).
\item 220' long (as long as a large passenger airplane).
\item 340' long (as long as an aircraft carrier).

\begin{question}
I was walking down Woody Hayes Drive, standing in front of
  St.\ John Arena when a car pulled up and the driver asked, ``Where
  is Ohio Stadium?'' At this point I was a bit perplexed, but
  nevertheless I answered, ``Do you see the enormous concrete building
  on the other side of the street that looks like the Roman Colosseum?
  That's it.''
 
The person in the car then asked, ``Where are the Twin-Towers then?''
Looking up, I realized that the towers were in fact just covered by
top of Ohio Stadium. I told the driver to just drive around the
stadium until they found two enormous identical towers---that would be
them. They thanked me and I suppose they met their destiny.

I am about 2 meters tall, I was standing about 100 meters from the
Ohio Stadium and Ohio Stadium is about 40 meters tall. If the Towers
are around 500 meters from the rotunda (the front entrance of the
stadium), how tall could they be and still be obscured by the stadium?
Explain your reasoning---for the record, the towers are about 80
meters tall.
