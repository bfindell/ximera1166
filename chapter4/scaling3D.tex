%\textbf{Definition.} Under a \textbf{dilation} about center $O$ and scale factor $r>0$, the image of $P$ is 
%a point $Q$ so that $Q$ lies on \wordChoice{\choice{segment}\choice[correct]{ray}\choice{line}} 
%$\answer[format=string]{OP}$ % $\overrightarrow{OP}$ 
%and $OQ=\answer[format=string]{rOP}$.  The image of $O$ is $\answer[format=string]{O}$. 

\section{Length, Area, and Volume Under Scaling}
In this section, we explore what happens to length, area, volume, and other measures under scaling.  
 

To explore how measures of figures change under scaling and non-scaling transformations, here are some useful strategies: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Cutting the figures and rearranging the pieces.  
\item Using ``rep-tiles.'' 
\item Using known formulas for perimeters, areas, volumes, or surface areas. 
\item Approximating with segments, squares, or cubes.  
\end{itemize}

% What about angles, perimeter, surface area, weight, and temperature
% Scaling versus stretching (other examples of non-scaling)
% Aspect ratio


\begin{question}
Given a cylinder of radius 5 and height 8, how many times greater will be the volume of \dots
\begin{enumerate}
\item \dots a cylinder with $k$ times the radius and the same height?  $\answer{k^2}$
\item \dots a cylinder with the same radius and $k$ times the height?  $\answer{k}$
\item \dots cylinder with $k$ times the radius and $k$ times the height?  $\answer{k^3}$
\end{enumerate}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Which of the following cylinders is similar to the given a cylinder of radius 5 and height 8?  
\begin{selectAll}
\choice{A cylinder with $k$ times the radius and the same height?}
\choice{A cylinder with the same radius and $k$ times the height?}
\choice[correct]{A cylinder with $k$ times the radius and $k$ times the height?}
\choice{None of the above}
\end{selectAll}

The similar cylinder will have surface area $\answer{k^2}$ times the surface area of the original cylinder.  
\end{question}
