Area under a dilation.

\begin{problem}
In a previous class, we made some measurements on sketch (below) of a dilation and used those measurements to determine the scale factor of the dilation. 
\begin{image}
\includegraphics[width=5in]{dilation.png}
\end{image}
Write three different expressions that would correctly compute the scale factor.

\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
To determine what happens to the areas of the figures under scaling, Isabel suggested that we overlay a grid on the pictures to estimate areas. 
\begin{enumerate} 
\item Compare and contrast the following two approaches to implementing Isabel's idea.  
\begin{image}
\includegraphics[width=4.4in]{dilationGrid1.png}

\includegraphics[width=4in]{dilationGrid2.png}
\end{image}
\item Complete the approach that you prefer to justify a relationship between the areas of the two red figures.  
\vfill
\item What can you say about a relationship between the perimeters of the red figures?  
\vfill
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\newpage
\begin{problem}
So far we have explored how lengths and areas of two-dimensional objects change under scaling.  How will these ideas generalize to three-dimensional objects?  Explain your reasoning.
