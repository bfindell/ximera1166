\begin{problem}
Given two sets $X$ and $Y$, explain what is meant by $X\cup Y$.
\begin{freeResponse}
$X\cup Y$ is the set of elements that are in $X$ or in $Y$ (or both, as the ``or'' is inclusive).  
\end{freeResponse}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Given two sets $X$ and $Y$, explain what is meant by $X\cap Y$.
\begin{freeResponse}
$X\cap Y$ is the set of elements that are in $X$ and in $Y$.  
\end{freeResponse}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Given two sets $X$ and $Y$, explain what is meant by $X - Y$.
\begin{freeResponse}
$X - Y$ is the set of elements that are in $X$ but not in $Y$.  
\end{freeResponse}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Explain the difference between the symbols $\in$ and $\subset$.
\begin{freeResponse}
The notation $X \in Y$ would mean that $X$ is a single element in the set $Y$.  In this case, $X$ might not be a set.  The notation $X \subset Y$ would require that both $X$ and $Y$ are sets and also that every element of $X$ is also in $Y$.
\end{freeResponse}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
How is $\{\emptyset\}$ different from $\emptyset$?  
\begin{freeResponse}
The empty set, $\emptyset$, is a set that contains no elements.  The set $\{\emptyset\}$ contains 1 element that is itself a set.  
\end{freeResponse}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Draw a Venn diagram for the set of elements that are in $X$ or $Y$ \emph{but not both}. 
How does it differ from the Venn diagram for $X\cup Y$?  
\begin{freeResponse}
Same as the Venn diagram for $X\cup Y$, except that the $X\cap Y$ part is not shaded.  
\end{freeResponse}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
If we let $X$ be the set of ``right triangles'' and we let $Y$ be the set of ``equilateral triangles'' does the picture below show the relationship between these two sets?
\begin{image}
  \includegraphics{set4.png}
\end{image}
Explain your reasoning.
\begin{freeResponse}
Yes.  The picture is accurate because no right triangles are also equilateral triangles.  
\end{freeResponse}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
If $X = \{1,2,3,4,5\}$ and $Y = \{3,4,5,6\}$ find:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $X\cup Y$
\item $X\cap Y$
\item $X-Y$
\item $Y-X$
\end{enumerate}
\begin{freeResponse}
\begin{enumerate}
\item $X\cup Y = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$
\item $X\cap Y = \{3,4,5\}$
\item $X-Y = \{1,2\}$
\item $Y-X = \{6\}$
\end{enumerate}
\end{freeResponse}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Let $n\Z$ represent the integer multiples of $n$. So for example:
\[
3\Z = \{\dots,-12,-9,-6,-3,0,3,6,9,12,\dots\}
\]
Compute the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $3\Z\cap 4\Z$
\item $2\Z\cap 5\Z$
\item $3\Z\cap 6\Z$
\item $4\Z\cap 6\Z$
\item $4\Z\cap 10\Z$
\end{enumerate}
In each case explain your reasoning. 
\begin{freeResponse}
\begin{enumerate}
\item $3\Z\cap 4\Z = 12\Z$
\item $2\Z\cap 5\Z = 10\Z$
\item $3\Z\cap 6\Z = 6\Z$
\item $4\Z\cap 6\Z = 12\Z$
\item $4\Z\cap 10\Z = 20\Z$
\end{enumerate}
\end{freeResponse}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Make a general rule for intersecting sets of the form $n\Z$ and
  $m\Z$. Explain why your rule works.
\begin{freeResponse}
The intersection of two sets is what they have in \emph{common}.  The intersection of set of multiples of $n$ and the set of multiples of $m$ are, in fact, called \emph{common multiples}, and they are all multiples of the least common multiple of $n$ and $m$.  
\end{freeResponse}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
If $X\cup Y = X$, what can we say about the relationship between the sets $X$ and $Y$? Explain your reasoning.
\begin{freeResponse}
$Y\subset X$ because every element of $Y$ must already be in $X$.  
\end{freeResponse}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
If $X\cap Y = X$, what can we say about the relationship between the sets $X$ and $Y$? Explain your reasoning.
\begin{freeResponse}
$X\subset Y$ because every element of $X$ must already be in $Y$.  
\end{freeResponse}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
If $X-Y =\emptyset$, what can we say about the relationship between the sets $X$ and $Y$? Explain your reasoning.
\begin{freeResponse}
$X\subset Y$ because that would mean $X$ contains no elements that are not also in $Y$.
\end{freeResponse}
\end{problem}
